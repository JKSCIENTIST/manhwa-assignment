Let me walk you through the assignment!!

## _**Brief :**_

- I have created a main "**app.py**" file which fetches the manhwa contents from the Azure SQL Database and displays in the website.
- Flask is utilized to host the web application.
- Requirements.txt file contains the packages required to run the app.py.
- The Images of the Manhwas are fetched from the Azure Blob Storage.
- The Insert-Data-To-DB.py file is used to insert the JSON content to the Database.
- The Fetch-Data-From-DB is used to fetch the data from the DB using a SELECT statement.
- The Upload-Images-To-Blob.py is used to upload the static assets [Images] to the Blob Storage.
- Index.html is the website.
- The .env will not be in this repo because it contains the important credentials.
- The Procfile is used to define the startup commands for custom applications. It tells Azure which process to run to start the app, such as launching a web server.
- GitHub Actions has been creates by the Azure Web Apps for CI and CD.
